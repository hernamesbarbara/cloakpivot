## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Parallel Implementation
Keep old implementations as `*_legacy.py` during transition:
```python
# During transition
if FEATURE_FLAG_NEW_ADAPTER:
    from .presidio_adapter_v2 import PresidioMaskingAdapter
else:
    from .presidio_adapter_legacy import PresidioMaskingAdapter
```

### 2. Incremental Testing
Run both implementations in parallel:
```python
def test_compatibility():
    result_old = old_implementation(data)
    result_new = new_implementation(data)
    assert result_old == result_new
```

### 3. Feature Flags
Use environment variables for gradual rollout:
```bash
export USE_NEW_PRESIDIO_ADAPTER=true
export USE_NEW_CLOAKMAP=false
```

### 4. Rollback Plan
Each PR must be independently revertible:
- Git revert for code changes
- Feature flags for runtime control
- Database migrations avoided
- No breaking API changes

## Success Metrics
