## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Project Configuration Standardization**: Adopted DocPivot's cleaner configuration approach
  - Simplified `pyproject.toml` by removing excessive comments and verbose configurations
  - Streamlined `Makefile` from 248 lines to 158 lines, removing redundant targets
  - Adopted DocPivot's minimal configuration style with selective enhancements
  - Removed redundant `PROJECT_CONFIG.md` documentation file
- **New Test Suite**: Complete rewrite of test infrastructure
  - Archived old tests to `tests_old/` for reference
  - Created clean test structure: `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`
  - Leverages real test data from `data/pdf/` and `data/json/`
  - Minimal fixtures focused on actual functionality
- **Compatibility Module**: New `cloakpivot.compat` module providing:
  - `load_document()` - Direct Docling JSON loading
  - `to_lexical()` - Conversion using new DocPivotEngine
- **Migration Guide**: Added `specification/CLOAKPIVOT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for DocPivot v2.0.1 migration

### Changed
- **Development Workflow**: Simplified to use Make commands exclusively
  - `make dev` - One-command development setup
  - `make all` - Single CI/CD pipeline entry point
  - `make check` - Quick pre-commit validation (format, lint, type, test-fast)
  - Removed redundant targets like `install-dev`, publishing targets, and verbose helpers
- **Configuration Philosophy**: Adopted DocPivot's cleaner approach
  - Removed 100+ lines of comments from `pyproject.toml`
  - Simplified pytest configuration to essential options only
  - Adopted moderate MyPy strictness with gradual typing
  - Kept test markers but removed verbose coverage requirements
- **DocPivot v2.0.1 Migration**: Updated to use DocPivot v2.0.1 with new `DocPivotEngine` API
  - Replaced `SerializerProvider` with `DocPivotEngine` in format registry
  - Replaced `LexicalDocSerializer` with `engine.convert_to_lexical()`
  - Replaced `load_document()` with direct JSON loading for Docling files
  - Added `cloakpivot.compat` module for backward compatibility
- **Document Loading**: Simplified to load Docling JSON files directly without DocPivot
- **Performance**: Improved performance with direct JSON loading and single engine instance

### Removed
- Excessive configuration comments in `pyproject.toml` (reduced by ~60%)
- Redundant Makefile targets (90+ lines removed)
- `PROJECT_CONFIG.md` documentation file (content already in README)
- `PERFORMANCE.md` - Outdated performance documentation referencing removed features
- `run_tests.py` - Redundant test runner (functionality in Makefile)
- `coverage.xml` - Generated file that shouldn't be in version control
- `htmlcov/` directory - Generated coverage HTML reports
- `test_reports/` directory - Old performance test reports no longer needed
- `tests_old/` directory - Archived old test suite replaced by new clean structure
- `benchmarks/` directory - Old performance benchmarking configuration
- `policies/` directory - Incomplete example policy templates never fully implemented
- `scripts/` directory - Obsolete performance and setup scripts
- `docs/` directory - Misleading documentation referencing non-existent v1.x
- Publishing targets from Makefile (not needed for internal project)
- Watch target and other rarely-used development helpers

### Fixed
- Import errors with DocPivot v2.0.1 API changes
- Test compatibility with new DocPivot API
- Over-engineered configuration files now simplified

### Removed
- **Dead Code Cleanup**: Major cleanup of unused and deprecated code
  - Removed empty `cloakpivot/policies/` directory (functionality in `core/policies.py`)
  - Removed `cloakpivot/deprecated.py` with broken imports
  - Removed entire unused `cloakpivot/observability/` subsystem
  - Removed unused modules: `core/chunking.py`, `formats/registry.py`, `masking/document_masker.py`
  - Removed dead batch processing modules: `cli/batch.py`, `core/batch.py`
  - Fixed broken imports throughout codebase
  - Removed obsolete test files with non-existent imports

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-13

### Added
- **CloakEngine API**: New simplified one-line API for PII masking/unmasking
  - `engine.mask_document(doc)` - Single method for masking with auto-detection
  - `engine.unmask_document(doc, cloakmap)` - Simple unmasking
- **CloakEngineBuilder**: Fluent builder pattern for advanced configuration
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured policies (default, conservative, permissive)
- **MaskResult**: Clean result type with statistics (entities_found, entities_masked)
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API reference in `docs/API.md`
- **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step guide for upgrading from v1.x in `docs/MIGRATION.md`
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for testing, building, and releasing
- **Python 3.8 Support**: Extended compatibility to Python 3.8+

### Changed
- **Simplified CLI**: Reduced from 2,794 to 175 lines with focus on core mask/unmask commands
- **Unified Engine**: Replaced separate MaskingEngine/UnmaskingEngine with single CloakEngine
- **Direct Returns**: `unmask_document()` returns DoclingDocument directly (not wrapped in result)
- **Result Property**: MaskResult uses `document` property instead of `masked_document`
- **Test Suite**: Refactored all tests to use CloakEngine API (63+ new tests)
- **Examples**: Replaced all examples with simple_usage.py and advanced_usage.py
- **Dependencies**: Simplified to core dependencies only (removed unnecessary packages)

### Removed
- **Legacy Modules** (12,347 lines removed):
  - `cloakpivot.migration.*` - CloakMap migration tools
  - `cloakpivot.storage.*` - Cloud storage backends (S3, GCS, Database)
  - `cloakpivot.plugins.*` - Plugin system
  - `cloakpivot.diagnostics.*` - Diagnostic tools
  - `cloakpivot.security.*` - Complex security module (1,290 lines)
  - `cloakpivot.observability.exporters.*` - Metric exporters
  - `cloakpivot.core.parallel_analysis` - Parallel processing
  - `cloakpivot.core.performance` - Performance optimization
- **CLI Commands**: Removed migration, diagnostic, batch, and plugin commands
- **Test Files**: Removed 23 test files for deleted modules

### Deprecated
- `MaskingEngine` and `UnmaskingEngine` classes (use `CloakEngine` instead)
- Separate text extraction and entity detection steps (now handled internally)
- Complex multi-step initialization (replaced with smart defaults)

### Fixed
- CloakMap version compatibility (now supports v1.0 and v2.0)
- Import organization and circular dependencies
- Test coverage for core functionality

### Performance
- 33.6% reduction in codebase size (36,747 â†’ 24,400 lines)
- Faster initialization with simplified architecture
- Reduced memory footprint with single engine design

## [1.8.3] - Previous Release

Last version with separate MaskingEngine/UnmaskingEngine architecture.
